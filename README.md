### Problem:
When looking at mental health, doctors will ask how symptoms are improving or worsening with treatment. This question can be difficult to answer because there are so many factors, and the outcome is hard to quantify. Inspired by Mark Watney I have decided to “science the sh*t” out of the problem.
